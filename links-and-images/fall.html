    <h3><b>Directions</b></h3>
    <h4><b>Step 1</b></h4>
    <p>
        Toss together the onion powder, parsley, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, seasoned salt,<br> 
        1 1/2 tablespoons black pepper, marjoram, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large, resealable plastic bag.<br> 
        Add the cubed pork, toss until well coated, then seal, and refrigerate overnight.
    </p>
    <h4><b>Step 2</b></h4>
    <p>
        Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line a 9x9 inch baking dish with half of the spinach leaves. 
    </p>
    <h4><b>Step 3</b></h4>
    <p>
        Pack the marinated pork into the baking dish, and cover with the remaining spinach leaves.<br>
         Cover the pan with aluminum foil, and bake in the preheated oven for 3 hours, or until the pork is tender.
    </p>
    <h4><b>Step 4</b></h4>
    <p>
        Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Whisk in the flour, and cook for 15 minutes, stirring <br>
        frequently until the flour has toasted. Scrape into a heatproof dish, and set aside. Melt the butter in the pot,<br>
        and stir in the onions and celery. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 10 minutes.<br> 
        Add the mushrooms, and cook until tender; stir the flour mixture back into the pot to coat the vegetables. 
    </p>
    <h4><b>Step 5</b></h4>
    <p>
        Pour in the beef broth, stewed tomatoes, cooked pork and spinach, bay leaves, red pepper flakes,<br>
         and 1 teaspoon garlic powder. Simmer 1 1/2 hours.
    </p>
    <h4><b>Step 6</b></h4>
    <p>
        Stir in the butter beans, yellow squash, and zucchini. Simmer 30 minutes until the vegetables are tender.<br> 
        Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
